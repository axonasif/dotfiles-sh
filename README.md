# Introduction

An asynchronous dotfiles _installer_ intended for use on Gitpod and locally. Batteries included!

What's special about it? Nothing. It's compilation of some automation to create consistent terminal-focused dev environment across different systems, that's all. There are no configuration files (such as `.yaml`) for this, it is meant to be edited from the source code and compiled.

## Features

- Dotfiles `install.sh` executes in **under 1 seconds**, thus your IDE starts quick nomatter how many things you configure/install.
- Tight integration with `tmux` (replaces Gitpod tasks and VSCode terminal-UI), optimized for plain SSH based workflow.
  - Launch gitpod workspaces automatically inside a [local terminal emulator via `ssh://`](#how-to-automatically-launch-gitpod-workspaces-inside-your-local-terminal-emulator) to skip all the manual steps to SSH from your terminal emulator (i.e manually copying the ssh command and running it on the terminal).
- Features **[live testing of dotfiles](#live-test-changes)** within your existing Gitpod workspace or locally so that you can prototype quickly without compromising your environment.
- Works both locally and on Gitpod.
- Uses your favorite shell on Gitpod task-terminals while perseving bash/posix compatibility with the task scripts.
- Save/restore/persist files **across** or **scoped-to-specific** Gitpod workspaces.
- Preserve existing host configs (e.g. `.bashrc`, `.gitconfig` and etc.) while applying `dotfiles` but inject your own configs on top of them when necessary.

# Quickstart for Gitpod

Simply put https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh on your [preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences).

# Quickstart for local machine

Right now **only Linux and MacOS is supported**. In theory it could work on other \*nix systems and maybe Windows, that said, the script would run fine but some special handling of how things are installed or configured needs to be done for these systems, please contribute if you're an user of an "unsupported" system.

## Prerequisites

- git
- bash 4.3 or above
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [bashbox](https://github.com/bashbox/bashbox#getting-started) (optional, only needed if you want to [live-test](#live-test-changes))

### Linux

Install `git` with your distro's package manager. Generally `bash` version is not an issue on Linux distros.

### MacOS

In MacOS you could install these via `brew` before proceeding.

```bash
# If you don't have homebrew already, otherwise skip this command
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

set -m # Disable job control temporarily
bash -lic 'brew install git bash'
set +m # Re-enable job control

exec bash -li # Reload bash
```

After you've made sure that the prerequisites are met, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh ~/.dotfiles
bash ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```

# How it works on Gitpod or local machine

A brief overview:

```markdown
â”œâ”€â”€ Gitpod clones this repo and executes `install.sh` from $HOME/.dotfiles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Asynchronously executes instructions inside `install.sh`
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Installs some system/userland packages
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Creates symlinks from your dotfiles sources to `$HOME/`while following`.dotfilesignore`via a helper function â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Installs CLIs such as`gh`, `gcloud`and auto-logins into them along several other tools â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Process Gitpod workspace persisted shell histories | | â”œâ”€â”€ Takes over how Gitpod starts the task-terminals and replaces them with`tmux` windows instead
â”œâ”€â”€ Gitpod starts the IDE process
â””â”€â”€ Logs are saved to $HOME/.dotfiles.log
```

# Customizing

For advanced customizations, fork this repo and make it your own. By default it will apply my raw dotfiles tree from https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles.public. If you wish to use your own raw dotfiles tree, you can either set [DOTFILES_PRIMARY_REPO](#dotfiles_primary_repo) or modify it [here](/src/install/dotfiles.sh) (recommended).

Ideally it should be easy to understand and customize this repo since I tried my best to make the code very modular and self-explanatory. Take a look inside the entrypoint [`/src/main.sh`](./src/main.sh) to tweak stuff as per your needs, such as commenting out any function on [`/src/main.sh`](./src/main.sh) to disable that particular thing.

## Live test changes

`dotfiles-sh` mimics a minimal a process of how Gitpod starts a workpsace and initalizes dotfiles in it. This way we can quickly test out our dotfiles without having to:

1. commit+push the changes
2. create new workspaces each time after that

which was a very annoying and time consuming process.

There is a custom box script defined inside the [`Bashbox.sh`](./Bashbox.sh) called [`live`](/Bashbox.sh#L23). You can execute it like so:

```bash
bashbox live
```

This will perform all the installation inside a docker container.

Thus, you can safely test out your new dotfiles changes without affecting the workspace or machine.

## Only compile

Run the following command:

```bash
bashbox build --release
```

This can be useful to only check for any compile time errors (e.g. syntax errors, missing files)

## Tweak behavior via environment variables

For Gitpod, you can set these on https://gitpod.io/variables with `*/*` as the scope.

For a local machine, you could do: `export KEY=value` once before executing `install.sh` per session.

Currently there are a few variables which can alter the behavior of `dotfiles-sh` on the fly:

### `DOTFILES_NO_VSCODE`

> Defaults to `false`.

> Gitpod only.

> Setting this to `true` will cause it to kill VSCode on Gitpod so that you can claim back your memory and CPU usage ðŸ˜œ

---

### `DOTFILES_SPAWN_SSH_PROTO`

> Defaults to `true`.

> Gitpod only.

> Setting this to `false` will cause it to skip launching your local terminal emulator via the `ssh://` protocol on Gitpod.

---

### `DOTFILES_PRIMARY_REPO`

> Defaults to https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles.public

> Setting this will change the primary dotfiles tree that `dotfiles-sh` will apply on `$HOME`.

> You can also define a local path instead of a URL. (i.e `DOTFILES_PRIMARY_REPO=/some/filesystem/dir`)

---

### `DOTFILES_DEFAULT_SHELL`

> Defaults to `fish`. (an absolute path to the binary could be used too, e.g. `/usr/bin/fish`)

> Gitpod only.

> It will be set as the default for:
>
> - Tmux
> - Fallback shell for Gitpod task terminals (i.e. tasks are run in `bash` but then auto switched to your specified shell)
> - VSCode terminal profiles

---

### `DOTFILES_TMUX`

> Defaults to `true`

> Gitpod only.

> Setting this to `false` will disable the use of tmux for all terminal creation across VSCode, task terminals and SSH.

# FAQs

## How to automatically launch Gitpod workspaces inside your local terminal emulator

As you may already know, Gitpod will automatically launch your [Desktop-VSCode](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode) for you if you selected to use it. However that's not the case for plain SSH based workflow yet (Related: https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/9323).

Although, since Gitpod is pretty scriptable and modular, it's possible to handle this ourselves until this has been polished out in the Gitpod side.

TBD, more to write here....

# Helper functions

These are some functions that you can use if you wish to do some advanced customization on your own.

## [vscode::add_settings](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles/blob/main/src/utils/common.sh#L6)

This let's you easily add settings to the Gitpod workspace VSCode instance. Settings added via this function will not be synced and is scoped to the applied workspaces only.

Usage example:

- Via stdin:

```bash
vscode::add_settings /path/to/settings.json <<-'JSON'
{
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
        "tmuxshell": {
            "path": "bash",
            "args": [
                "-c",
                "tmux new-session -ds main 2>/dev/null || :; if cpids=$(tmux list-clients -t main -F '#{client_pid}'); then for cpid in $cpids; do [ $(ps -o ppid= -p $cpid)x == ${PPID}x ] && exec tmux new-window -n \"vs:${PWD##*/}\" -t main; done; fi; exec tmux attach -t main"
            ]
        }
    },
    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "tmuxshell"
}
JSON
```

Live usage example can be seen [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/config/tmux.sh#L238).

- Via file:

```bash
vscode::add_settings /path/to/settings.json < /path/to/source_file.json
```

## [dotfiles::initialize](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/common.sh#L52)

Automatically clone and symlink from a remote `dotfiles` repository tree. It also cleans up broken symlinks from previous apply (useful when used on local PC). You can ignore symlinking files by specifying their paths on a [`.dotfilesignore`](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles.public/blob/main/.dotfilesignore) on the repo root of your dotfiles raw tree.

Usage:

```js
REPO="your-repo-link/path-here" dotfiles::initialize [target-dir]
```

`REPO=` accepts URL or local path. (Defaults to https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles.public)

`REPO=` and `target-dir` is optional.

`target-dir` is the directory/folder where symlinks will be applied from the cloned repo. (Defaults to `$HOME`)

If you wish to apply the symlinks to a different directory for example:

```js
REPO="your-repo-link/path-here" dotfiles::initialize "/root/.local/very/deep/location";
```

Live examples of it's usage can be found on this [file](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/install/dotfiles.sh)

## [await::until_true](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/await.sh#L1)

```js
await::until_true <cmd>;
```

Simple wrapper for awaiting a command to return `true`

Live usage example can be found [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/config/tmux.sh#L296).

## [await::for_file_existence](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/await.sh#L9)

```js
await::for_file_existence <file_path>;
```

Await for a file to appear in the filesystem.

Live usage example can be found [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/common.sh#L36).

## [await::for_vscode_ide_start](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/await.sh#L14)

```js
await::for_vscode_ide_start;
```

Await for the Gitpod VSCode window to appear.

Live usage example can be found [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/install/gh.sh#L11).

## [await::create_shim](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/await.sh#L37)

```js
await::create_shim /usr/bin/something_fancy
```

### Problem 1

---

Let's say we're intalling a tool called `tmux` but since it's asynchronously installed so if an user tries to execute it before it exists, they'll get an error. In order to avoid such a problem we can place an wrapper script at `tmux`'s absolute path using `await::create_shim`, that way the wrapper script as `tmux` will await for the actual command to appear in the filesystem and switch(`exec`) to it if someone executes `tmux` on their terminal before the actual `tmux` binary/program gets fully installed. In other words, if you invoke `tmux` on your terminal, the wrapper script at `/usr/bin/tmux` will `sleep()` until it finds that it itself was overwritten and the actual `tmux` binary was installed at `/usr/bin/tmux`.

Now, there is another problem, let's say you used `await::create_shim /usr/bin/tmux` while `tmux` is being installed in the background asynchronously. What if you also need to install/configure additional `tmux` plguins/customizations from your dotfiles installation script but the _user_ tried to run `tmux` before you installed the additional customization. In this case, `tmux` would start up without your customization during the process you may perform the customizations in the background. There is a solution to that. Here's an example below:

```bash
# Install tmux asynchronously in the background
sudo apt install tmux & disown;

# Create the awaiting shim for any user execution before apt fully installs tmux, notice the extra `KEEP=true`
KEEP=true await::create_shim /usr/bin/tmux;

## Extra tmux customization/configuration part
git clone --filter=tree:0 https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm "$HOME/.tmux/plugins/tpm";
# This script has to execute `tmux` internally multiple times
# But we need it to hit the actual tmux binary but not the wrapper shim script,
# however the wrapper shim script will recognize that it's being called from inside the dotfiles installation script
# and thus it will let us to execute the actual binary of `tmux`
bash "$HOME/.tmux/plugins/tpm/scripts/install_plugins.sh";

# After we're done customizing internally, get rid of the wrapper shim script
# and let everyone directly hit the actual `tmux` binary.
CLOSE=true await::create_shim /usr/bin/tmux;
```

A live usage of `KEEP=true await::create_shim` can be seen [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/config/tmux.sh#L250).

### Problem 2

---

What if you want to install `tmux` with a much complicated package manager such as `nix` for example and that you have to install `nix` first. Well, in that case, if you create the placeholder dirs and the shim before installation of `nix` and the package that you want to install, then it will cause issues during installation of `nix` and the packages that you want to install via it afterwards. So, we can create a shim in a different PATH, which will monitor another path to swap itself with. Here's an example:

```bash

# Install nix if missing
USER="$(id -u -n)" && export USER;
if test ! -e /nix; then {
  sudo sh -c "mkdir -p /nix && chown -R $USER:$USER /nix";
  log::info "Installing nix";
  curl -sL https://nixos.org/nix/install | bash -s -- --no-daemon >/dev/null 2>&1;
} fi
source "$HOME/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh" || source /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/profile.d/nix-daemon.sh;

# Install packages with nix in the background
# This command will eventually install a symlink to `tmux` at $HOME/.nix-profile/bin
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.tmux & disown;

# Notice the CUSTOM_SHIM_SOURCE value
KEEP=true CUSTOM_SHIM_SOURCE=$HOME/.nix-profile/bin/tmux await::create_shim /usr/bin/tmux;

## Extra tmux customization/configuration part
git clone --filter=tree:0 https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm "$HOME/.tmux/plugins/tpm";
# Install tmux plugins
bash "$HOME/.tmux/plugins/tpm/scripts/install_plugins.sh";

# After we're done customizing internally, get rid of the wrapper shim script
# and let everyone directly hit the actual `tmux` binary.
CLOSE=true await::create_shim /usr/bin/tmux;
```

## [await::signal](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/await.sh#L20)

Let's you await between multiple async commands.

Example:

In function `foo` we have:

```bash
function foo() {
    await::signal get boo_is_cool; # Blocks execution until signal is received

    echo "Now we can proceeed!";

    # More commands below...
}
```

In function `boo` we have:

```bash
function boo() {
    # Let's run some random commands
    sudo apt install shellcheck;

    await::signal send boo_is_cool; # Sends the singal to any awaiting client so that they can continue execution
}
```
