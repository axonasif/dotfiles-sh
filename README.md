# Introduction

This is a wannabe asynchronous dotfiles _installer_ intended for use on Gitpod and locally. Batteries included!

Highlights:

- Dotfiles `install.sh` executes in **under 1 seconds**, thus your IDE starts quick nomatter how many things you configure/install.
- Tight integration with `tmux` (replaces Gitpod tasks and VSCode terminal-UI), optimized for plain SSH based workflow.
  - Launch gitpod workspaces automatically inside a [local terminal emulator via `ssh://`](#how-to-automatically-launch-gitpod-workspaces-inside-your-local-terminal-emulator) to skip all the manual steps to SSH from your terminal emulator (i.e manually copying the ssh command and running it on the terminal).
- Features **[live testing of dotfiles](#how-to-live-test-changes)** within your existing Gitpod workspace itself so that you can prototype quickly.
- Works both locally and on Gitpod.
- Uses your favorite shell on Gitpod task-terminals while perseving bash/posix compatibility with the task scripts.

# How to use on Gitpod

If you want to quickly try it out, simply put https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh on your [preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences).

Later if you feel like performing advanced customizations, fork this repo and then you can then use it on [preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences) for Gitpod. By default it will apply my raw dotfiles tree from https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles.public . If you wish to use your own raw dotfiles tree, you can either set [DOTFILES_PRIMARY_REPO](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh#dotfiles_primary_repo) or modify it [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/install/dotfiles.sh).

# How it works on Gitpod

A brief overview:

```markdown
â”œâ”€â”€ Gitpod clones this repo and executes `install.sh` from $HOME/.dotfiles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Asynchronously executes instructions inside `install.sh`
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Installs some system/userland packages
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Creates symlinks from your dotfiles sources to `$HOME/` while following `.dotfilesignore` via a helper function
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Installs CLIs such as `gh`, `gcloud` and auto-logins into them along several other tools
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Process Gitpod workspace persisted shell histories
|   |   â”œâ”€â”€ Takes over how Gitpod starts the task-terminals and replaces them with `tmux` windows instead
â”œâ”€â”€ Gitpod starts the IDE process
â””â”€â”€ Logs are saved to $HOME/.dotfiles.log
```

# Customizing

Ideally it should be easy to understand and customize this repo since I tried my best to make the code very modular and self-explanatory. Take a look inside the entrypoint [`/src/main.sh`](./src/main.sh) to tweak stuff as per your needs, such as commenting out any function on [`/src/main.sh`](./src/main.sh) to disable that particular thing.

## How to compile

Run the following command:

```bash
bashbox build --release
```

## How to live test changes

`dotfiles-sh` mimics a minimal a process of how Gitpod starts a workpsace and initalizes dotfiles in it. This way we can quickly test out our dotfiles without having to:

1. commit+push the changes
2. create new workspaces each time after that

which was a very annoying and time consuming process.

There is a custom package script defined inside the [`Bashbox.sh`](./Bashbox.sh) called [`live`](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles/blob/main/Bashbox.sh#L23). You can execute it like so:

```bash
bashbox live
```

And it will test out your new dotfiles changes inside the existing workspace without affecting it. Sounds fun, right!?

## How to automatically launch Gitpod workspaces inside your local terminal emulator

As you may already know, Gitpod will automatically launch your [Desktop-VSCode](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode) for you if you selected to use it. However that's not the case for plain SSH based workflow yet (Related: https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/9323).

Although, since Gitpod is pretty scriptable and modular, it's possible to handle this ourselves until this has been polished out in the Gitpod side.

TBD, more to write here....

## Tweak behavior via environment variables

For Gitpod, you can set these on https://gitpod.io/variables with `*/*` as the scope.

Currently there are a few variables which can alter the behavior of `dotfiles-sh` on the fly:

### `DOTFILES_NO_VSCODE`

> Defaults to `false`.

> Setting this to `true` will cause it to kill VSCode so that you can claim back your memory and CPU usage ðŸ˜œ

---

### `DOTFILES_SPAWN_SSH_PROTO`

> Defaults to `true`.

> Setting this to `false` will cause it to skip launching your local terminal emulator via the `ssh://` protocol.

---

### `DOTFILES_PRIMARY_REPO`

> Defaults to https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles.public

> Setting this will change the primary dotfiles tree that `dotfiles-sh` will apply on `$HOME`.

> You can also define a local path instead of a URL. (i.e `DOTFILES_PRIMARY_REPO=/some/filesystem/dir`)

---

### `DOTFILES_DEFAULT_SHELL`

> Defaults to `/usr/bin/fish` (this is planned, not implemented yet).

> This is the shell that our `tmux` session will use.

## Helper functions

These are some functions that you can use if you wish to do some advanced customization on your own.

### [vscode::add_settings](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles/blob/main/src/utils/common.sh#L6)

This let's you easily add settings to the Gitpod workspace VSCode instance. Settings added via this function will not be synced and is scoped to the applied workspaces only.

Usage example:

- Via stdin:

```bash
vscode::add_settings <<-'JSON'
{
	"terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
		"tmuxshell": {
			"path": "bash",
			"args": [
				"-c",
				"tmux new-session -ds main 2>/dev/null || :; if cpids=$(tmux list-clients -t main -F '#{client_pid}'); then for cpid in $cpids; do [ $(ps -o ppid= -p $cpid)x == ${PPID}x ] && exec tmux new-window -n \"vs:${PWD##*/}\" -t main; done; fi; exec tmux attach -t main"
			]
		}
	},
	"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "tmuxshell"
}
JSON
```

Live usage example can be seen [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/config/tmux.sh#L238).

- Via file:

```bash
vscode::add_settings /path/to/file.json
```

### [dotfiles::initialize](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/common.sh#L52)

Automatically clone and symlink from a remote `dotfiles` repository tree. It also cleans up broken symlinks from previous apply (useful when used on local PC). You can ignore symlinking files by specifying their paths on a [`.dotfilesignore`](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles.public/blob/main/.dotfilesignore) on the repo root of your dotfiles raw tree.

Usage:

```js
REPO="your-repo-link/path-here" dotfiles::initialize [target-dir]
```

`REPO=` accepts URL or local path. (Defaults to https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles.public)

`REPO=` and `target-dir` is optional.

`target-dir` is the directory/folder where symlinks will be applied from the cloned repo. (Defaults to `$HOME`)

If you wish to apply the symlinks to a different directory for example:

```js
REPO="your-repo-link/path-here" dotfiles::initialize "/root/.local/very/deep/location";
```

Live examples of it's usage can be found on this [file](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/install/dotfiles.sh)

### [await::until_true](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/await.sh#L1)

```js
await::until_true <cmd>;
```

Simple wrapper for awaiting a command to return `true`

Live usage example can be found [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/config/tmux.sh#L296).

### [await::for_file_existence](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/await.sh#L9)

```js
await::for_file_existence <file_path>;
```

Await for a file to appear in the filesystem.

Live usage example can be found [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/common.sh#L36).

### [await::for_vscode_ide_start](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/await.sh#L14)

```js
await::for_vscode_ide_start;
```

Await for the Gitpod VSCode window to appear.

Live usage example can be found [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/install/gh.sh#L11).

### [await::create_shim](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/await.sh#L37)

```js
await::create_shim /usr/bin/something_fancy
```

Let's say we're intalling a tool called `tmux` but since it's asynchronously installed so if an user tries to execute it before it exists, they'll get an error. In order to avoid such a problem we can place an wrapper script at `tmux`'s absolute path using `await::create_shim`, that way the wrapper script as `tmux` will await for the actual command to appear in the filesystem and switch(`exec`) to it if someone executes `tmux` on their terminal before the actual `tmux` binary/program gets fully installed. In other words, if you invoke `tmux` on your terminal, the wrapper script at `/usr/bin/tmux` will `sleep()` until it finds that it itself was overwritten and the actual `tmux` binary was installed at `/usr/bin/tmux`.

Now, there is another problem, let's say you used `await::create_shim /usr/bin/tmux` while `tmux` is being installed in the background asynchronously. What if you also need to install/configure additional `tmux` plguins/customizations from your dotfiles installation script but the _user_ tried to run `tmux` before you installed the additional customization. In this case, `tmux` would start up without your customization during the process you may perform the customizations in the background. There is a solution to that. Here's an example below:

```bash
# Install tmux asynchronously in the background
sudo apt install tmux & disown;

# Create the awaiting shim for any user execution before apt fully installs tmux, notice the extra `KEEP=true`
KEEP=true await::create_shim /usr/bin/tmux;

## Extra tmux customization/configuration part
git clone --filter=tree:0 https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm "$HOME/.tmux/plugins/tpm";
# This script has to execute `tmux` internally multiple times
# But we need it to hit the actual tmux binary but not the wrapper shim script,
# however the wrapper shim script will recognize that it's being called from inside the dotfiles installation script
# and thus it will let us to execute the actual binary of `tmux`
bash "$HOME/.tmux/plugins/tpm/scripts/install_plugins.sh";

# After we're done customizing internally, get rid of the wrapper shim script
# and let everyone directly hit the actual `tmux` binary.
CLOSE=true await::create_shim /usr/bin/tmux;
```

A live usage of `KEEP=true await::create_shim` can be seen [here](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/config/tmux.sh#L250).

### [await::signal](https://github.com/axonasif/dotfiles-sh/blob/main/src/utils/await.sh#L20)

Let's you await between multiple async commands.

Example:

In function `foo` we have:
```bash
function foo() {
	await::signal get boo_is_cool; # Blocks execution until signal is received

	echo "Now we can proceeed!";

	# More commands below...
}
```

In function `boo` we have:
```bash
function boo() {
	# Let's run some random commands
	sudo apt install shellcheck;

	await::signal send boo_is_cool; # Sends the singal to any awaiting client so that they can continue execution
}
```
